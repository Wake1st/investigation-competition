Name = "Sir Geoffrey Bradford the 2nd"
Description = "Like expensive wine burried deep in the cellar - refined, yet overlooked; his smug ambivalence poorly hides the pain of unrequited respect from a cold hearted father. Years of straining for said respect have coerced the man into making many ill-advised ventures, resulting in considerable financial loss, ever adding to the immeasurable debt of shame he so desperately wishes to pay. "
