Name = "Major Thomas O'Leary"
Description = "Cheerful, radiant, and energetic - the Major was well suited for marching to the military drum, but life as a civilian has proven more difficult; he has many aquaintences but few friends, for he keeps more than military secrets close to his chest - how he longs for the company of comrades now lost to the battlefield. "
